Instructions:
Protect the integrity of the Nexus by maintaining data flow through the node network.

As the Nexus's gatekeeper, guard the data flow to the Nexus while removing flashing corrupt data. Confront the infiltrating bots and repair the nodes damaged by their energy charges to ensure data transmission. Manage power reserves used by energy pulses and node repair, power is slowly restored from the network currents and energy surges provide power boost while the energy spikes drain power. Nexus's data processing and integration supports its virtual presence, and loss of its digital integrity that threaten system failure results in network shutdown.

Nexus can run with Python2.7+/Pygame. Alternatively, the app can run in the Java environment (http://www.java.com/getjava/) using Jython 2.2.1+ with the PyJ2D library. Obtain Jython (http://www.jython.org/) and install or put the standalone interpreter in or on the path of the app folder. Obtain PyJ2D from its project site (http://gatc.ca/projects/pyj2d/) or Github repository (https://github.com/jggatc/pyj2d/) and unpack the library in or on the path of the app folder. Run using the command ‘jython nexus.py’ or ‘java -jar jython.jar nexus.py’. Nexus 1.0 runs as a PyJ2D app with minor issues, which are fixed in Nexus 1.1 on the Github repository (https://github.com/jggatc/nexus/releases/). The app can also run in the JavaScript environment following Pyjs compilation with the Pyjsdl library, though there are issues with Nexus 1.0 that are partly addressed in Nexus 1.1, see Nexus project site for further information.
